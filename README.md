Supported:

-   `melody-streams`
-   Melody-style ref handlers that can be shared across many nodes
-   `dispatchCustomEvent` works

Todo:

-   Implement compatibility layer for `melody-component` style API
-   Implement compatibility layer for `melody-hoc`

Problems:

-   must rely on Preact internals to get access to DOM nodes
